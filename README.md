Data munging is performed, several actionable insights can be derived from the Play Store apps data.
# Problem Statement
<p>Before we can derive any meaningful insights from the Play Store data, it is essential to pre-process the data and make it suitable for further analysis. This pre-processing step forms a major part of data wrangling (or data munging) and ensures better quality data. It consists of the transformation and mapping of data from a "raw" data form into another format so that it is more valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. Data analysts typically spend a sizeable amount of time in the process of data wrangling, compared to the actual analysis of the data.</p>
